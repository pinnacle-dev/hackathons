# Hackathons

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our Hackathons repo

## Current projects

- SmartRent door unlocking / wifi access control
- ArXiv AI paper updater (with Mendeley reader counts for trending papers)
- The hackathon project for all hackathons (text to see all demos)

Each Monday, we're creating a couple fun projects that use RCS, so you can check them out here but we'll also be posting these + how we made them to the showcase on [our discord community](https://discord.gg/tT3n4Gmf)

## Submissions

- Feel free to submit your own mini-projects to this repo--it's always to see what people are building + we might send you something

## Getting started with Pinnacle

- You can signup for access [here](https://www.trypinnacle.app/access)
- We'll have a quick onboarding / intro call, then we can get you setup with your own agent to start sending RCS business messages

That's it!
